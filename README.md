## Modifictions to this Assignment

If this assigment were to become an official assignment in the future, a good modification would be to make the students write their own test cases. This not only will help them to be more
comfortable writing test cases, but it also teaches them to understand when the code should or should not work. Having the test cases made for us can make us overlook a lot of things.
